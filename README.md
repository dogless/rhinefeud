Rules:

1.  One individual per family come up to get an answer.
    The family whose individual got more points goes first.
    If both got the same amount of points, the family whose individual
    buzzed first goes first. If both missed the question,
    then repeat 1. with the next individual per family.
2.  The family in control has three strikes to fill the board.
    Each individual must be able to provide an answer under a time limit;
    the family members cannot discuss amongst themselves.
3.  If the family in control reaches three strikes,
    then the other family's team captain may try to provide an answer.
    The family may discuss amongst themselves before providing the answer.
    If correct, the family steals the other family's points;
    otherwise, the other family keep their points.
4.  Follow the same for round 2, round 3 for double points,
    and round 4 for triple points.
